# Changelog

## v0.1.5 (2026-06-07)

- Project configs are now discovered from `.sideagent.yaml`, and the default user config lives under `~/.config/sideagent`.

## v0.1.4 (2026-06-06)

- Added project config discovery with `.sideagent.yaml`, so repositories can provide their own profiles without passing `--config`.
- Delegated tmux panes now open next to the pane running `sideagent` without changing the rest of the window layout.

## v0.1.3 (2026-06-06)

- Added Cursor Agent as a supported interface.
- Cursor Agent workspaces are marked trusted before launch, so delegated runs do not stop on workspace trust prompts.

## v0.1.2 (2026-06-06)

- Added provider-aware skill installation for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi
- Added Cursor Agent as a supported interface.

## v0.1.1 (2026-06-06)

- Added headless mode so delegated agents can run as non-interactive subprocesses without tmux.

## v0.1.0 (2026-06-06)

Initial release.
